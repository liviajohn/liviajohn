Hi there! I'm a student currently pursuing Software Engineering. I enjoy learning new tools and techniques to create efficient and reliable applications. Whether it's developing software systems, web design, or applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems, I'm always eager to learn and contribute.

Currently, I'm improving my skills in software development, machine learning and data analytics through hands-on projects like predictive modeling for auto insurance claims to improve cost estimation and decision making.

As excited as I am to learn, I also love to inspire, motivate and collaborate with others to celebrate even the smallest victories. I've experienced this as a tutor for elementary students and as a fellow in the Break Through Tech AI program, where I've had the chance to grow alongside others and share in their success.
