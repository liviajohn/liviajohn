Hi there!

I'm a student currently pursuing Software Engineering. While I'm learning new things every day, I'm excited about crafting efficient and dependable applications, whether it's in web development, mobile apps, or exploring machine learning through my program at Break Through Tech AI/ML.

Currently, I'm improving my skills in software development through hands-on projects and coursework, aiming to make a positive impact in the tech industry.

Outside of coding, you can find me exploring new trails, practicing yoga, or diving into a good book.
