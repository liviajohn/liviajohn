Hi there! I'm Livia John.

I'm a student currently pursuing Software Engineering. I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks to create efficient and reliable applications. Whether it's web development, mobile apps, or exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence, I'm always eager to learn and contribute.

Currently, I'm improving my skills in software development through hands-on projects and coursework, aiming to make a positive impact in the tech industry.

Outside of coding, you can find me exploring new trails, practicing yoga, or diving into a good book.
