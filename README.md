Hi there!

I'm a student currently pursuing Software Engineering. While I'm still learning new things every day, I'm enthusiastic about crafting efficient and dependable applications, whether it's in web development, mobile apps, or delving into the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I'm improving my skills in software development through hands-on projects and coursework, aiming to make a positive impact in the tech industry.

Outside of coding, you can find me exploring new trails, practicing yoga, or diving into a good book.
